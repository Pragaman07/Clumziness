Kaise start kre koi idea nhi aa rha. Kuch words ko type kr rhe hai fir hata de rhe hai. Kuch aisa mil hi nhi rha jo un sare moments ko lekr mere andr jo feelings hai usko express kr ske. But anyways I am gonna try my best to let you know what that date and you mean to this stupid man. So I know i have said it multiple times but not even in my wildest dream maine socha tha that sadi se pehle hm aapke saath itna time uninterrupted spend kr payenge. Sochte bhi kaise aakhir dono toh conservative pro max hai and hamesha sbse safe way ko select krte hai taki koi bhi problem na ho. But es bar jo hmne risk liya everything was worth that risk.

Wo 26 April ki raat se lekr wo saath mei aapke college jakr migration lana. Fir swarg mei wo saath mei dosa rasmalai and paw bhaji khana and aapka meko raste mei jor jor se chilla ke bulana and mere na sunne pe gusana last mei wo saath jake aapke liye choclate lana and fir aapka gussa hoke us choclate ko ek anjan insan ke bike pe chor ke jane ki dhamki dena. Ab toh aap hmse ladne se bilkul bhi nhi sharmati ekdum Bibi ke jaise kahi bhi gussa kr jati hai road ho ya room meri cutioo meko hr jgh daant lagati hai.But aapki daant bhi aachi lagti hai aapka ruthna bhi aacha lgta hai and sbse aacha lagta hai aapka mujhpe hak jatana.

Hm aapke hai poore ke poore. Every thing I have is yours and I wanna share each and every moment of life with you. Aap jb har chhoti cheez ke liye bs esliye wait krti hai because wo aapko mere saath krna hota hai that makes me feel like I am the luckiest person in this world. Chahe wo ghr aane ke baad bhi wait krna taki aap mere saath chicken popcorn kha ske. Ya fir Anamika di ko chhor ke mere saath bus mei aana everything is so so so precious for me. Anjali ye 3 aur 4 june jo hmne saath mei spend kiya na wo mere liye mere life ke sbse best 2 din the. I know bohot sare problems aaye like bus ka jada time lagana ya fir wo hotel ka issue and hmara dar jana wo barish mei bheengte hue khane ke liye restaurant khojna ya fir sb thik ho jane ke baad aapka tabiyat kaharab ho jana. Movie ka ek part chut jana ya fir college mei aapka kam na ho pana. But en sare moments mei aap mere saath thi and ye sb kb aaye and kb resolve ho gaye pata bhi nhi chala. Pata chala toh bs ye ki jb aap mere saath hai toh hm duniya mei kisi se bhi lad skte hai. Kaisa bhi problem ho aapke saath sb ko solve kr skte hai. I know we can enjoy together in any condition because to have a special moment welo need special things we need each other Pragaman needs his Anjali and Anjali needs her Pragaman. We both are special for each other and jb hm saath hote hai toh simple si pani puri khana ho, aapka hanth pkd kr road par krana ho, Baithe hue auto mei se hme daant khilwa kr utrewa dena ho,Raat mei baith ke subh ki bachi sbji and pasta ke saath noodles khana ho, ek hi glass mei shake pina ho,same icecream share krna ho ya fir bed pe hamara non stop romance ho sb kuch special hota hai.

I Love you a lot and I know what I have become in your life and what importance you have given me. I will always take care of you. I live in love with you and one thing which I want in my life permanent is you and all your memories. Love you sonna.❤️`

You make me feel safe to come out of my shell.
I love and cherish each and every moment spent with you.
I feel butterflies in my stomach just listening to your voice.
I can't stop smiling when I see your face.
I know I am not the same person which I was two year ago... I have made so many mistakes you have forgiven me so many times and gave me the chances to correct my mistakes..
I feel so lucky to be with you.
You are very kind hearted.
You care about little things.
You have loved me through my imperfections.
Sometimes you can be little childish and very hard to handel..
But I love the way you are each and everything about you..
I love you because you have given me the trust that you will stay with me through thick and thin times..
I love you because I see a beautiful future with you..
I love you because you are mine
I love you because I just wanna be yours..

I love you not only because your looks or your body don't get me wrong I love those things about you but it's not only about that there's so much more to you then just looks. Like how you love to see other people happy and you hate how people only like you for your looks and when Your alone things get to you more easily. There's so much more then just looks I love you for you. So to answer your question i love you because when I met you I never knew whether I was going to fall in love with you ir not but when I met the real you I automatically fell in love and when I saw the real you, you not your looks you, your personality. The way you talked and laughed and the way you had me smiling over something not that big of a deal I knew I fell in love so the reason I love you is because of you, your personality.`

Anjali with you I feel happy,I feel sadness, I feel great, I feel madness, Sometimes I am pleasing, sometimes very irritating.
Sometimes I understand without even saying. Sometimes not even if you are repeating.
Sometimes it's hard, Sometimes it's easy.
Sometimes even hours passes by and we don't wanna cut the call.
Sometimes even minutes you feel like not to talk.
Sometimes I make you laugh so much
Sometimes I made your mood go off.
Sometimes I am very understanding
Sometimes I am so much demanding.

All the things happens for sometime and some for another time but you know that the one thing which happens everytime..

Everytime I love you,I care about you,I want to be around you,I don't wanna lose you. You may get angry and irritated at me but No matter what happens no matter how much angry I am I never want to be apart from you.`

In the time which I was able to spend with you I got to know you more and more. I was able to connect with you on different levels. I had never thought that I would be able to be with someone so awesome,so beautiful,so cute, but here I am with love of my life, the person who matters most to me.
Pta hai ek bohot famous quote hai
"I fell in love with you not for how you look, just for who you are''( although my cutie looks pretty good too)
Anjali you have made me one of the happiest man on this earth and I want to reciprocate this happiness to you. I wanna make you feel how you make me feel. Here is a small poem for you.

लिखने को मैं,
हजारों अल्फाज लिखना चाहता हूं।
मेरे दिल पे जो बीती हर वो बात लिखना चाहता हूं।
मैं हर वो अश्क, हर वो जज़्बात लिखना चाहता हूं।
आपकी यादों में बीती हर वो रात लिखना चाहता हूं।
अपनी आम सी जिंदगी में आपको खास लिखना चाहता हूं।
और आखिर में ...
खुद के नसीब में जिंदगी भर के लिए आपका साथ लिखना चाहता हूं।

अंजली... शायद हम कभी भी वो शब्द खोज ही न पाए जो सच में बता सके की आप मेरे लिए क्या मायने रखती है। पर कोई न हम अपनी पूरी जिंदगी उन शब्दों को खोजते खोजते बीता सकते है।

Maybe I feel in love with you unexpectedly,but now I plan to be with you forever.

So today I wanna ask you Anjali...
Will you be my girlfriend?
Will you be my valentine?
Will you be the love my life?`

It's the name with the help of which I have been able to do lots of things which were previously unimaginable for me. And I promise you will always have this much importance and speciality in my life always..

Today I can't promise you that there will be no problem in our life or that our future will be full of rainbows. I can't promise you that tomorrow will be perfect or that our life would be easy. No I can't promise that.But I can promise you my everlasting respect, my loyalty and my unconditional love towards you for the lifetime.
I can promise you that I will always be here for you,to listen to your talks, your problems and hold your hand.
I will always do my best to make you happy and to make you feel what you mean to me.
I can promise you that together with you I can handle every problem that comes our way.
I will pray with you.
I will dream with you.
I will build our small world with you.
I will always cheer you and stand by your side in all your decisions.
I promise you that the things that are important for you will always be important for me too.
I promise that I will always be your protector,your advisor,your friend,your family,your everything.
I promise you. I know I will have to work overtime to fulfill so many roles and so many promises but I promise you that I will happily do all this for you my cutie.

I may not be your first crush or your first
love. But I just want to be your last everything.And I will do everything in my control to make sure you will be happy with me.
Because me and you can make the whole world jealous with the understanding and love we have for each other ❤️.
I know that I make mistakes and I am not perfect. Sometimes I have jealousy issues. Sometimes I am overthinker's king. I may be little moddy maybe a little bit more moddy sometimes and stuck to some things. But I promise you that when I say I love you to you.. I mean it every single time. I will always be loyal to you and I will do everything to be with you. Don't confuse my caring for controlling. Your happiness mean everything to me. Together we are strong enough to overcome worst of situations. Without you I crumble in best situations.I don't know what it likes to be without you. It's the only thing I don't want to know ever.I love you Anjali and I promise you that I will always love you and take care of you. Always put you forward before myself. I promise you 💖`

There's something in a simple hug from your special one it always warms your heart, It makes us feel close and it makes easier to say goodbye. When I hug you I want to share my joy and my sadness times with you.🥰

Hugs from your special one is very special. It's the purest form to express love physically, just in the perfect way. When you don't know what to say at some moment,Just hug me it will express everything 💓

It's actually funny how imagining hugging you makes me feel so good;And do you know special things about hugs. It doesn't need anything new or any sophisticated action.Just open up your arms And open up your hearts.. Happy Hug 🤗 day my cutie 🥰. wanna hug 🫂 you so badly 🥹.`

Soon the covid came and there was a break in our conversation for some time."

Next day she answered “I don’t have such feelings for you....”. This was the worst thing that could have happened to this shy guy. The first attempt of mine was not the success which i hoped for.But one thing which i am always good at is WAITING.So, now the waiting game in our relationship started and i promised her “Just talk as friends for now you will have that feeling later.”"

From waking up early in the morning to why she not use her phone in night before she goes to bed,Why she should exercise regulary and many more..But hey i was not distracted from my main goal i.e. to make her feel that feeling.I did continued my flirting and we were getting more comfortable around each other by each passing day."

This may have been the worst thing i could have chossen at that time and i did choose that.I said the things to her which i didn’t felt at that moment.
